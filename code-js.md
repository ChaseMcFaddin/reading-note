> A **script** is a series of instructions

Think of a script like reading a food recipt or assembling manual. It explains a goal, and then gives step by step instructions to complete the task.

Writing a script involves 3 steps:
1. Define goal
2. Design script
3. Code each step of the script

> An **expression** evaluates results into a single value

There are 2 types of expressions:

1. Expressions that assign a single value to a variable
2. Expressions that use two or more values to a single value

> **Operators** allow programmers to create a single value from multiple values
 
### **Arithmetic Operators**

 Name |  Operator | Purpose |
 --------- |----------- | ---------
 Addition    | `+` | Add one value to another |
 Subtraction | `-` | Remove one value from another |
 Multiplication | `*` | Multiplies two values |
 Division |`/` | Divides two values |
 Increment | `++` | Adds one to the current number |
 Decrement | `--` |  Removes one from the current number |
 Modulus | `%` | Divides two numbers and returns the remainder |


### **String Operators**

- There in only one string operator `+` and it's used to combine strings on either side of it.


> A **function** allows you to combine multiple instructions together to perform a singular task.
