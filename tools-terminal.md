## Terminal Tools & Notes

Learning your terminal starts with choosing a text editor. When picking out the best text editor for you, I think it's best to look for 4 main features
1. Code completion
2. Syntax highlighting
3. Variety of themes
4. Multiple extensions

Now that you've picked out a text editor, let's talk terminal

### **Terminal Tools**

Some quick notes for myself within terminal
- **prompt** @user-chase
- **command** is the first input
- **option** is the first command line argument
- **the shell** determines how the terminal will behave
- **BASH** is Bourne again shell
- *shortcuts* available are **UP** and **DOWN** arrows to cycle between recently used commands
  - **LEFT** and **RIGHT** are used to edit command

### **Terminal Commands**

Basic navigational tools for terminal:
- `pwd` is print working directory
- `ls` is for shortlist 
- `cd` is for cahnge directory
- `touch` to create a file
- '`mkdir` to make a directory




Next we talk paths
> A path is how to get to your desired object. There are two types of paths:

1. Absolute
2. Relative

The file system works in a hierarchy system with the top being the root directory.

- The absolute path works through the root directory level by level using `**/**`
- The relative path looks for a file in regards to our current location `(No use of **/**)`

Everthing is your directory is a file. Commons extensions include:
- `.txt` which is plain text
- `.exe` which is an executable file
- `.png` which is an image file

Important things to remember in the terminal:
- Case sensitivity **matters**
- Spaces **matter**
  - Use quotations to allow for spaces and to select specific file names
- Hidden files begin with a period '.'
