## Refactoring

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions

- Pure functions are determined by:
  1. It returns the same result if given the same arguments
  2. It does not cause any observable side effects

Immuatability refers to data that cannot be changed or given a new value

Referentially transparent refers to a function that consistenyl yeilds the same result for the same input

`pure functions + immutable data = referential trasparency`

- Functions as first-class entities are treated as values and used as data
 These can:
 - Refer to it from constants and variables
 - Pass it as a parameter to other functions
 - Return it as a result from other functions
 

## Higher order functions 

- These are functions that:
  1. Take one or more functions as arguments
  2. Return a function as a result
  
- Types
  + Filter
  + Map
  + Reduce
