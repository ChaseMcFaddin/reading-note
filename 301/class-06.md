## Read 06: Node, Express, APIs


- NodeJs is a runtime built on Chrome V8
 - However, NodeJs doesn't run using the browser, instead it is a collection of a HTTP library, a file-system API, numerous operating system-related utility methods, and other various features.
 
- Using a node version manager is preferable over node binaries because it allows you to switch between different nodes and use multiple versions at will.

NodeJs works effortlessly with Javascript

NodeJs uses package.json to declare different dependencies and access lodash and any of its libraries

NodeJs allows us to run Javascript on the server

NodeJs is suited for applications that require real-time feedback, interaction, or collaboration

The biggest advantage of NodeJs (other than speed and scalability) is the ability to switch between the server and client side using the same language.
