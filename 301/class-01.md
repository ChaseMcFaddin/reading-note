### Flexible Layouts, Media Queries, & Flexible Media

    - Flex grid allows us to take fixed units and scale them proportionally within a fixed container
- Media queries allows us to alter media types (styles and targets) within different browsers
    - These can use three logical operators (all, only, and not) to allow for multiple conditions to be present
      - Other media features include:
        - Omission
        - Height & Width
        - Min & Max
        - Orientation
        - Aspect Ratio
        - Pixel Ratio
        - Resolution
        - Output Colors
**Mobile First** is a popular technique used in targeting styles a smaller viewpoints and then using media queries to add on as viewpoint increases.
