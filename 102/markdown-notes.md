  ## Markdown Notes
  
  Today we learn about markdown commands and how they help us in being more effecient.

- Hashtags are headers h1-h6
    - One `#` is for H1, `##` for H2, so on and on
- `**` for bold `**bold**`
- `*` for italics `*italics*` 
- ***. for bold & italics `***both***`
- ~~ for strikethroughs `~strikethrough~`
- `>` for indented quotes
- we can wrap link text in `[ ]` and then paste URL in `( )`
- can use lists and nested using `-`, `+`, and `#`
- task manager with - [x] or [ ]
- Can use emojis with :EMOJICODE:
- create paragraphs with a blank line of space
- tag users with `@` just like in many social messaging apps (i.e. discord, slack
)
- create tables using hyphens
