**Forms**

HTML uses forms to gather information from visitors

Form Controls:
1. Add text
  - text input, password input, text area
2. Making choices
  - radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-down boxes
3. Submitting forms
  - submit buttons, image buttons, uploading files

Form Structure:
1. `<form>`This element contains the action & attribute. It usually includes an id and method as well
2. `<input>` It used to create several different form controls
  - types include password, checkbox, 
3. `<textarea>` It is used to create a multi-line text input
4. `<select>` Refers to a drop down box
5. `<button>` This element allows users to have more control over button appearance
6. `<label>` This helps vision impaired users
7. `<fieldset>` Can group related forms together inside

Each form control is given a name, and the text the user inputs are sent to the server
