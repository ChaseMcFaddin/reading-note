**HTML/CSS NOTES**

- ol (ordered list)
- ul (unordered list)
- dl (definition list)
nested list is created with a tab

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is a box

This boxes can be adjusted by:
- width
- height

You can limit and expand the height and width with `min` and `max` tags
- min-width
- max-height

Overflow lets the browser know what to do with content that is larger than the box. It can either be 
1. hidden
2. scrollable

- Border separates the edge of the box from other boxes (middle level)
- Margin sits outside the border (outside level)
- Padding increases distance between border and content (inner layer)

White space is a term used to define the empty space between objects

You can adjust the borders:
1. Color
2. Width
3. Style

You can use **shorthand** to edit all three in one property

You can make inline boxes into block-level boxes and vice versa

You can use CSS to style boxes with:
1. Border images
2. Box shadows
3. Rounded corners
4. Elliptical shapes


**JS Notes**

The `if` and `else` statement checks a condition. It is true it runs the first code block, if it's false, it runs the second. 

A `switch` statement starts with a switch value, if that value is matched, it runs that code block.

JS uses `weak typing` which can lead to unexpected results, this is why it is important to use strict ===

Due to this `weak typing`, JS treats values as if they are true or false.

`Short circuit` values stop processing when they find a result, whether it is true or false

Loops check a condition, if its true, the code bluck runs, if false, the loop continues until true.

Loop types:

1. For
2. While
3. Do While
