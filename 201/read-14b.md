**Google Teams**

Google set out on mission to figure out what made certain teams successful and other's not as much. Was it as simple as putting the most talented people together in a group or was it better to group together coworkers who were also friendly outside of work?

To solve this, they put together a team of psychologist, sociologists, statisticians and engineers to form Project Aristotle.

After studying over 180 different teams at Google, no evident patterns emerged. It didn't matter what friendship levels were present or what management style was used. The results from groups of identical makeups would sometimes result in wildly different effectiveness levels.

The one thing that they did notice however was that different teams would establish a set of "norms". These could be unspoken or discussed rules amongst the group, but having these shared ideals seemed to be a benefit. Therefore, Project Aristotle set out to find a way to understand and influence these group norms.

The one norm that pointed towards success was creating psychological safety. There were other behaviors that were important as well such as - having clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. However, establishing this type of environment widespread is tricky.

At the end of the day though, Project Aristotle learned what all good managers already knew. The key to success is members listening to each other and showing sensitivity to their feelings and needs. 

One line that resonated with me is:
- It's sometimes easy to forget that success if often built on experiences - like emotional interactions and ocmplicated conversarions and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel.
