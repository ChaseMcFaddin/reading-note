**HTML/CSS**

Using links in HTML can be very beneficial

A common tag to reference different links is `a href`

When referencing links within your own page, you can use shorthand instead of actual url links. This is known as **relative urls**

It's important when building a site and links to build a well thoughtout directory structure

Relative links can be accessed by referencing the correct folder
1. Parent
  - ../foldername
2. Child
  - /foldername
3. Grandparent
  ../../foldername
4. Grandchild
  /childfolder/foldername
5. Same page
  - Just use the name

`mailto` directs to an email
`target` opens a new tab
