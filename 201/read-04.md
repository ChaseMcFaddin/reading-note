**HTML/CSS**

Using links in HTML can be very beneficial

A common tag to reference different links is `a href`

When referencing links within your own page, you can use shorthand instead of actual url links. This is known as **relative urls**

It's important when building a site and links to build a well thoughtout directory structure

Relative links can be accessed by referencing the correct folder
1. Parent
  - ../foldername
2. Child
  - /foldername
3. Grandparent
  ../../foldername
4. Grandchild
  /childfolder/foldername
5. Same page
  - Just use the name

`mailto` directs to an email
`target` opens a new tab




**JS Notes**

JQuery is what programmers refer to as a Javascript library

Ajax is a technique for loading data into a page without needing to refresh

JSON - Javascript Object Notation

Ajax uses a asynchronous processing model to help the user do other things while the browser is still loading.

It's important to remember how the webpage will operate without the Javascript enabled.

You can incorporate JS, AJAX, and JSON into your page. 

`.load()` is the easiest way to load HTML into your pages

`.ajax()` is more powerful and more complex
