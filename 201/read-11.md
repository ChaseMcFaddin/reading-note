Analytics: 

As soon as your site begins gaining traffic, you can get data on the users such as:
- Visits
- Unique visits
- Page views
- Pages per visit
- Average time on site

We use analytics to figure out:
- What are visitors looking at
- Where are visitors coming from
- How many people are coming to our site

To put your site on the web, it will need a domain name and web hosting (usually a third party site)

+ FTP (File Transfer Protocol) programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server

**Video & Audio APIs**

HTML5 comes with elements `<video>` and `<audio>` which in turn come with their own APIs that control playback, seeking, etc.

These elements allow us to embed a video player into our site

We can then use CSS to style the video player
```
.controls{
  visibility: hidden;
  width: 400px;
  background-color: black;
  margin-left: 25px;
}
```

We can even style the buttons on the video player as well as adding effects such as hover.

You can then use JS to play with the start/stop times and even set an eventListener for video interaction.

In conclusion the `HTMLMediaElement` API allows us a ton of functionality when adding a video player to our site.
