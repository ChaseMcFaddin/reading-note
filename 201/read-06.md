## Object Literals & the DOM

**Objects**


Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize in the real world. In a object the variable becomes known as `property` and the function is known as the `method`.

Properties and methods have a name and value - `key`

A property can be a string, boolean, number, array, or even another object.

A method is always a function

Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects

```

hotelName = hotel.name;
hotelName = hotel.checkAvailability();

```
hotel = object
name/checkAvailability = property/method name

**DOMS**

Document Object Model (DOM) 

The DOM specifies to the browser how to interact with JS using the DOM tree

The DOM tree consists of 4 nodes:
1. The Document Node
  - 
2. Element Nodes
3. Attribute Nodes
4. Text Nodes
