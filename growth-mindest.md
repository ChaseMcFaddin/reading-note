## The Growth Mindset
  
  The best way for me to describe the growth mindset is to compare it to the old adage my grandmother would always say:
  
  > Your attitude determines your altitude.
 
  It's all embracing the glass **half full** instead of *half empty*. Instead of focusing on jealously, embrace teamwork; instead of harboraging ill will towards criticism, evolve the feedback into productivitg. The Growth mindset lays out five fundamental concepts: 
  - Challenges 
  - Obstacles 
  - Effort  
  - Criticism 
  - Success of Others
 
  These are the five pillars of which the pursuit of knowledge stands upon. How you react to each situation will not only affect how you will succeed in solving a problem, but also how you evolve into a more complete person intellectually and emotionally. 
  My three reminders to help keep me in a growth mindset have always been: 
  
  1. Don't be complacent:
    - I've never wanted to be the dumbest person in the room.
  2. Strive for a better tomorrow: 
    - Always be willing to learn and grow
  3. Reach your goals: 
    - A reminder that not only knowledge, but the pursuit of it will lead to new paths that will help me accomplish my goals.
