## The Growth Mindset
  
  The best way for me to describe the growth mindset is to compare it to the old adage my grandmother would always say:
  
  > Your attitude determines your altitude.
 
  It's all embracing the glass **half full** instead of *half empty*. The Growth mindset lays out five fundamental concepts: 
  - Challenges 
  - Obstacles 
  - Effort  
  - Criticism 
  - Success of Others

  Each of these pillars signifies an opportunity for potential growth. 

  1. **Challenges** should be embraced. Don't let the fear of of somthing difficuly keep you from growing.
  2. **Obstacles** are inevitable. Don't let small failures affect you from reaching your goals.
  3. **Effort** is something only you control. The old saying is work smarter, not harder; but I like my mother's version better:
  > why not work harder amd smarter
  4. **Criticism** can be a tricky one. It's important to being able to reflect on yourseld and your weaknesses and use criticism in order to evolve.
  5. **Success of Others** is all about being a team player. It doesn't much matter if you scored 50 points in a game if your team still loses. Be a Lebron James or Steph Curry, not a Russell Westbrook.
 
  These are the five pillars of which the pursuit of knowledge stands upon. How you react to each situation will not only affect how you will succeed in solving a problem, but also how you evolve into a more complete person intellectually and emotionally. 

 ### **My Personal Reminders**
  
  1. Don't be complacent:
    - Be a better version of yourself each and everyday
  2. Strive for a better tomorrow: 
    - Always be willing to learn and grow
  3. Reach for the stars: 
    - It's a cliche, but if you don't push yourself, not one else will.
