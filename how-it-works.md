## **How a Computer Works**

In this discussion, we will talking about computers: How they work, what they do, 


### **What Makes a Computer a Computer?**

Though computers can come in very different forms, they all have 4 simple things in common. They all process information in the same way: 

1. **Take Input** 
2. **Store Information**
3. **Process It**
4. **Output the Results**


### **Binary & Data**

1 wire equals 2 options = bit

Binary Number system = 2 digits

- Text
- Images
- Sound
- Photos
- Videos
- Graphics

These can all be processed into binary data

**Images** are represented through pixels; **Sound** is graphed numerically by waveform


### **Circuits & Logic**

Circuits are just wires that process data through a series of `yes or no`, `on or off`, or  `0 or 1` questions.

Adding multiple wires or circuits together lets' you process more complex information quickly and effeciently

Logic Gates = multiple circuits

**Adder** is two circuits combined


### **CPU, Memory, Input & Output**

Input can be received from devices such as
 - keyboard
 - mouse click
 - microphone

 Memory stores this information

 A CPU (Central Processing Unit) that processes this information

 Output devices can be:

 - monitor screeen
 - cell phone
 - robot or machine

 1. Input are transferred into binary
 2. That input goes into memory
 3. It's processed into a pixel or whatever respective unit
 4. This then displays on your output device


### **Hardware & Software**

Software are computer programs that work together with the physical hardware of the device.

THe memory holds commands and the CPU uses these commands to process data.

Software examples:
- Python
- Ruby
- Javascript

The **operating system** controls the software on the computer. It decides whether or not the CPU can access Input and Output devices.
